Below the mirror leans a photograph; she’s the only woman he’s ever whispered to...
And now that he’s alone, he doesn’t care how much older he looks, how far south his face has drifted. 
And the lighting in the hallway doesn’t help, it makes everything a sorry pale of yellow.

He pops open a tin of emulsion with a screwdriver that once belonged to his father. They didn’t get along and this type of tool no longer fits even a common screw. Yet he’s inherited his old man’s hands and has convinced himself that something redundant can be an heirloom.

The decoration is on a whim, to commemorate an anniversary designed for two. The colour has been absent from any reasonable selection chart for many seasons. And the only decent sized brush he could find is the type designed for wallpapering. The bristles are long, blond and soft, they remind him of  the type once used by a gentleman’s barber to sweep clean between your collar and your neck.

Without his glasses he can’t be distracted by the ancient newspapers spread out as a drip sheet: Dennis bends down like a cinematic priest and fully loads the paint.
He knows that too much emulsion is a bad idea for the unpractised, but figures a quick flick of the wrist will deliver most to the wall from where he’ll work it smooth.

Just as he commits to the movement there’s someone at the door:
He’s startled by a rat-a-tat-tat on the brass knocker...the visitor is very close, barely two feet from his crouched position...and the hallway carpet is rolled up - the sound is stark and metallic rather than soft and wooden. He jolts like you do in the deepest of sleeps when your dream demands a quick escape.
He closes his eyes and swears at the wall. 
And when he opens his eyes he could wail his hatred - the first of the paint has touched his grip. And like a time-lapsed glacier the body of the pigment is following...

 - again the brass knocker is assaulted with a strident confidence that could never be welcome in a house that once was a home.

The rhythm is repeated - perhaps the idiot with the musical knuckles is showing off?

He wants to pull open the door and tell him to fuck off - an invitation to be delivered through a shower of spittle.

But instead he inverts his hand to reverse the flow; these days Dennis hates inwardly, he hurts only himself behind a face of scowl and frown.

He knows that the unwanted visitors can see him through the obscured glass now that he’s stood upright. He contemplates pretending to be deaf,  but he’s been superstitious since giving up the church...

There stands the vicar and her curate.
They are distributing prayer cards; collecting reasons for them that do, to flock.

I guess collective goodwill can’t be all bad? - Dennis asks.

No, she affirms.

The curate shakes his head like he’s over-acting for the benefit of a 5 year old.

Your next-door neighbour-but-one, she’s filled-in three! - Grins the vicar.

What?

The lovely old lady two doors down, she asked for three prayer cards.

She’s got a lot of time on her hands, far too much.

I think she’s lonely?

I thought you said she was lovely?

Can’t you be both?

The curate looks at his boss like he wants to remember that one.

I can smell her garden from here. Says Dennis.

The curate cocks his head to one side and sniffs the air like a feisty spaniel.

You can smell her garden from here? - Asks the vicar.

I can. And it’s only Easter...just wait ‘til summer thickens the air.

- silence

But sir, do you have anyone we can pray for? Insists the vicar.

The curate agrees, he tilts his head to one side and smiles like flatus.

Perhaps you should pray for me? She tests my resolve. She really does.

I think it’s she that needs the help.

She needs help alright.

- all three look down, their eyes follow the sodden glop of fresh paint hitting the newspaper.

The curate grimaces like a painful memory.

She’s all alone. And her precious garden is completely overgrown - she can’t even
reach the fence when she pushes her walking stick through the hedge!

- silence

The curate looks at Dennis: how can you bear to think of a little old lady struggling with an overgrown bush?

- silence

I’ve got a longer stick she can borrow, she’s welcome to that?

 - & the curate laughs!

He laughs so deep he coughs - Then coughs and laughs as well.

The curate laughs so deep, so thoroughly, that as he spits the final exhale he tastes the cat excrement from the back of his throat.

Songbirds shall die.
